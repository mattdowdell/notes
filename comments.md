- Team stages: Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing.
- [Rule of 3](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/work-deliberately-instead-reactively-rule-3/).
- [How to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY).
- Align to business goals and focus areas; innovate in relevant areas.
- Default to standard design patterns, hard to go wrong.
- Bounded contexts, Domain Driven Design.
- Split up microservices with different APIs, SLOs, performance and failure conditions.
- Minimum 3 replicas in a Kubernetes deployment for high availability.
- Display usecases and SLOs upfront; make it clear what you do and how well.
- [4 Golden Signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/).
- Teams with backbone don't ask permission to fix issues, tech debt, etc.
- Always push for versioned APIs, deprecation windows and SLAs/SLOs (availability, latency, traffic).
- Be transparent about the feedback you give about those you lead; say it to them as well.
- Be thoughtful in the feedback you provide.
- Build communication skills, evangelise (preach) good ideas and values.
- Make sure you have a solid, uncompromised foundation, otherwise it will eventually bite you.
- When replacing a legacy system, cordon off parts and replace them separately.
- Declarative infrastucture is best, actions/imperative causes trouble eventually.
- When starting a new role:
  - Figure out their standards, philosophies, etc.
  - Understand the build and deployment, work backwards from there.
  - Be helpful.
  - Spread questions around the team, avoid asking just 1 person.
- When hiring, look for:
  - Software engineers that are willing to generalise, steer clear of those that won't adapt.
  - People that will be a good influence and take pride in their work.
  - People that can teach others well.

- A well-ordered presentation will answer questions as they arise.
- Take opportunities; they won't be offered again, but there may be other opportunities.
- Part of getting opportunities is luck, but maximising them takes more.
- Do what you want to do rather than what someone tells you to do.
- Show how what you want to do will add business value.
- Experience can help you identify good and bad ideas, but sometimes you need to wing it regardless.
- Everything old is new, even AI (statistical analysis).
- Watch out for when you've reached the limits of what the job has to offer.
- Attrition is normal, clears the way for new people to step up and grow.
- Promotions for high levels require need/space (attrition) and funding from the business.

## Eric

- Establish technical credentials before offering contrasting opinions, more likely to be taken seriously.
- Volunteer for work outside your day-to-day activities.
- Fully understand a counter proposal before accepting or rejecting it.
- Take emotion out of conflicts, focus on just the facts (Dragnet approach).
- Do your own research and form your own opinion when mediating conflicts, reframe the problem as necessary.
- Senior technical roles are very different, expect to deal with the abstract rather than the technical.
- Senior technical roles can take a lot of getting used to, not enjoyable or worthwhile for everyone.
- Some companies have a role for very senior coders, e.g. NetApp, but it's rare.
- Work at a promising and interesting startup if possible; it will provide little monetary reward, but you can learn a wide array of skills for future roles.
- Being excited about work is ok, but learn to switch off. Life is often more important.
- Move into uncomfortable areas, look out for new roles at around 5 years maximum.
- Learning to write customer-facing documentation can make your design documentation better.
- Taking over an established, poor quality team can be demoralising if you aren't empowered to overhaul it.

## Nigel

- Don't discount or neglect non-technical resources, soft skills are necessary to get to senior positions.
- [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/]
- Senior positions can provide more personal comfort, but they require personal sacrifice.
- Small scale people management can improve soft skills, but leave space to continue developing technically.
- Need to be proactive to prevent attrition of top talent. Waiting until they leave is always too late.
- Outages and security issues are rarely straightforward, take early headlines with healthy scepticism.

## Other

- People don't scale, but good documentation can.
- Not all microservices are equal, critical services should be held to higher standards.
- Avoid high latency, synchronous workflows; partition them off if they must exist.
- Build dashboards to monitor metrics and understand normal behaviour, add alerts when well understood.
- Recognition day/week can be useful for amplifying completed work, but only if it's top of mind.
