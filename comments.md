- Team stages: Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing.
- [Rule of 3](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/work-deliberately-instead-reactively-rule-3/).
- [How to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY).
- Align to business goals and focus areas; innovate in relevant areas.
- Default to standard design patterns, hard to go wrong.
- Bounded contexts, Domain Driven Design.
- Split up microservices with different APIs, SLOs, performance and failure conditions.
- Minimum 3 replicas in a Kubernetes deployment for high availability.
- Display usecases and SLOs upfront; make it clear what you do and how well.
- Teams with backbone don't ask permission to fix issues, tech debt, etc.
- Always push for versioned APIs, deprecation windows and SLAs/SLOs (availability, latency).
- Be transparent about the feedback you give about those you lead; say it to them as well.
- Be thoughtful in the feedback you provide.

- Take opportunities; they won't be offered again, but there may be other opportunities.
- Part of getting opportunities is luck, but maximising them takes more.
- Do what you want to do rather than what someone tells you to do.
- Show how what you want to do will add business value.
- Experience can help you identify good and bad ideas, but sometimes you need to wing it regardless.
- Everything old is new, even AI (statistical analysis).
- Watch out for when you've reached the limits of what the job has to offer.
- Attrition is normal, clears the way for new people to step up and grow.
- Promotions for high levels require need/space (attrition) and funding from the business.

- People don't scale, but good documentation can.
- Not all microservices are equal, critical services should be held to higher standards.
- Avoid high latency, synchronous workflows; partition them off if they must exist.
