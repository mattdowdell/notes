- Take opportunities; they won't be offered again, but there may be other opportunities.
- Part of getting opportunities is luck, but maximising them takes more.
- Do what you want to do rather than what someone tells you to do.
- Show how what you want to do will add business value.
- Experience can help you identify good and bad ideas, but sometimes you need to wing it regardless.
- Everything old is new, even AI (statistical analysis).
- Watch out for when you've reached the limits of what the job has to offer.
- Attrition is normal, clears the way for new people to step up and grow.
- Promotions are high levels require need/space (attrition) and funding from the business.
